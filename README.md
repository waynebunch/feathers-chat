**For those asking, these are needed to do this:  NodeJS and npm (included with node)

I'm new to Git as well so bear with me...**

Windows: https://nodejs.org/en/

Linux: Available for all package managers I would imagine. Archlinux has it available in official repo.

#FeathersJS Test Application Breakdown

Next I'm going to learn more ES6, Express, Node, and FeathersJS by breaking down a test app availale at:

https://docs.feathersjs.com/getting-started/readme.html

This looks like a pretty promising framework that I'm sure I'll be using.

What it is:

	1.  Built on top of Express
	2.  Services oriented.  These services are easy to create (takes 10 seconds and is automatic) and provide 
	    full CRUD on a resource. Resource can be located literally anywhwere.
	3.  Hooks!  This is what really piqued my interest.  Allows before and after methods to be performed on services.
		https://docs.feathersjs.com/hooks/readme.html
	3.  Pick and choose what you want to install.  Feathers can be added to an Express program after it's
	    already created!
	4.  Uses socket.io for "real-time" communications
	5.  Supported by a TON of db's
		1. AsyncStorage - feathers-localstorage
		2. localStorage - feathers-localstorage
		3. Memory - feathers-memory
		4. MongoDB
		5. NeDB - feathers-nedb
		6. RethinkDB - feathers-rethinkdb
		7. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite
		8. Oracle - feathers-knex
		9. Microsoft SQL Server - feathers-sequelize
		10. Redis
		11. Riak
		12. Neo4j
		13. OrientDB
		14. ArangoDB
		15. Apache Cassandra
		16. GraphQL
		17. LevelDB
		18. Amazon DynamoDB
		19. Windows Azure Table Storage
		20. Redis
		21. Riak
		22. Google Sheets

	6.  Full authentication and authorization built in (JWT Web Joken)

Really, check it out as I didn't even scratch the surface.

I'll be adding breakdowns of each file as I see them (breakdown folder), as I try to understand what the hell is going on.

I task you to make me look good.

Thanks!
